Poem
If you can keep your he#ad when all
ab#out you.
Are losing theirs and blaming at on you . 
If you can trust yourself when all men
doubt you ,
But make allowance for their doubting too ;
If you can wait and not be tried 
by waiting , or being lied about , don't 
deal in lies , or being hated don't give 
way to hating ,
And yet don't look too good . nor
talk to wise :
If you can dream - and not make dreams 
your master ;
If you can think - and not make thoughts 
your aim .
