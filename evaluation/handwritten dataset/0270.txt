Human structures such as buildings and roads can
reduce # infiltration and water-storage capacity of
floodplain soils leading to increased flood frequency
and intensity . Some agricultural practices , such as
rice farming , are typically not associated with
these negative impacts and are therefore not
restricted in most floodplains . Properly functioning
floodplains reduce the negative impacts of floods
( by reducing severity of flood ) , and they assist in
filtering stormwater and protecting the water
quality of rivers . They also act as areas of
recharge for groundwater . The United States of
America ( US ) has numerous rivers that run throughout
the nation's landscape . It is estimated that the
US has over 200,000 rivers with the Mississippi
River being the largest by volume despite
it only being the second longest .
