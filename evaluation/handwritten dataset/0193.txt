Criticism is a literary subject in which we evaluate
and criticise the literary texts , It is taught to
us by Sir Basheur . We are not really good in
criticism . In this subject , we study the works of
Plato , Aristotle , longinus and Sir Philiph Sydney .
We are recently learning Aristotle " Poetics ". In
poetics Aristotle has talked about Art , tragedy
and types of tragedies . According to him , Art
is imitation of nature and action of man . And
he defines tragedy as " imitation of an action
serious in nature , complete on itself , written in
# dialogue not narrative form , rising pity and
fear as to attain the Catharsis of emotion ." He
has also mentioned types of poetry i.e Epic ,
comedy and mock epic It is really interesting
and we hope to attain a good GPA in it .
I will try to read alot to be good in
criticism .
