Recently , we have studied Drama written by Christophor 
Marlow ' Dr. Faustus ' . In which the protagonist has 
amazing knowledge about different fields . In very first 
scene , we come to know that he is not satisfied 
with his knowledge . He wants to gain immortality 
by doing something different / astonishing , that's why he 
starts learning magic . He justafied himself by 
saying he will do something good for people . 
But when learned # black magic , he started 
doing stupid things and more like a 
strect joker . So the basic theme here in 
this drama to not cross limit .
