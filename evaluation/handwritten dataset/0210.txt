Post modern fiction is a broader phenomenon
that moves from a modernism . Basically , it is the
most ambigous and complex phenomenon which
has rejected all the meta narratives of modernism
and takes the minority and marginalized groups
into account . Furthermore , in post modern literature ,
we have post modern fiction i-e science fiction
which deals with the multiple truths or lies .
The most important feature of post modern
fiction is parody and pastiche . Parodly is basically
the immitating style or manner of particular
writer about original work to radicule it . It simply
highlights the flaw to make it correct . Pastiche
on the other hand is to combine together multiple
elements which in a sense is the reworking on
already existing work . Inshort , post modernism
is a shift from modernism in all sense . Acco-
rding to Jean Francios Lyoterd :
" incredulity towards metanarratives . "
