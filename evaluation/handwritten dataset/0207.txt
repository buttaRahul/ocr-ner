Nelson Mandela who was born in South 
African village named as Qunu where education 
was not given importance . Fields of crops were
there a lot in which all the people of 
that village took interest . # Mandela also 
practiced in such activities in fields .
His village name was Ralahlaha . One day a
stranger visited that village and saw Mandela 
writing something on the ground . He saw 
something in him . He met with his father 
but he refused the stranger that Ralahlahla 
will not study . One day, Mandela’s father was 
not # feeling well . So , he told his son that 
you have the permission to go & study . 
Then he joined a circumcision school where 
# students became men # and when they were 
given their degrees they were circumsised 
and it was the # rule to be a
man .
