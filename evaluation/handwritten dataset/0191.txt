psychoanalytical theory
the self , the 'O'ther & the 'O'ther
Today , I have read an article about
psychoanalytical theory . it tells us about
the concept of the self , and the 'O'ther and 
the 'o'ther . Self is the central 
figure of oneself . The 'O'other is the
ideal and the 'o'ther is the 
replica the image created by the 
self . How these all are related ? 
Let's take an example of a child . A 
child always considered himself as the 
central figure of the picture but they 
always need the care of their parents 
which indicates that they ( parents ) love ideal .
But when a child looks in the mirror ,
they can see their # own image . They think
that the image in the mirror is dependent on 
them as it appears and shows #movement when
the child comes infront of the mirror . This 
shows that the #image in the mirror is the 'o'ther .
