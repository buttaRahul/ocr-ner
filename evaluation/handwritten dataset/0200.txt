Recently , I read a book Reclaim Your
Heart by Yasmin Mogahed . It is all about 
Spirituality and personality development .
The author # tells that how to built a 
deep connection with Allah and she gives 
a lot verses from Quran about how
Allah loves His creatures .
She gives hope to readers that
don't be despire Allah is always with 
us in the context of Quran she says that 
# # We always says that our
life is not perfectly good , but think , 
think again that our life # our 
life is not perfectly bad .
