Don't eat the eyes of
a humble soul by the
farness oh lord .
Servents are the ones
for which you are too humble
and compassionate . That's the words
of a soul touches the sky
makes the sky shy , by comincing
to your glory .
In every breath oh lord you
colored that soul with your
divine light with the divine
passion of your , and with
the complete satisfaction by you .
The one you are everwhere .
Where ever I go I find you and
With each glace of mine of find
you , So don't let your Servent
away from yourself even a bit of moment .
