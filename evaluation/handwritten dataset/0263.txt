There are three main sectors that use
water – industrial , agricultural , and domestic .
When water is removed from its source
such as river or lake and returned to
this source after use , this is
referred to as non-consumptive use . An
example is when water is used
to in industrial cooling , it may
be temporarily placed in cooling ponds
and later returned back to the river
or lake that it came from . Consumptive
use is when water is taken out
from a source and consumed by
plants and animals or used in industrial
processes . The water enters animal tissue
or becomes part of industrial products
or evaporates during use and is
not returned to its source . # #
