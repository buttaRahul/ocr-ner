The United States of America ( US ) has
numerous rivers that run throughout the nation's
landscape . These rivers are important sources
of water for cities and their populations .
The rivers also contain important biological
communities and provide opportunities for
recreational activities such as swimming ,
fishing , canoeing , and white-water rafting
among others . Rivers largely control
settlement patterns all over the world due
to their widespread distribution and
being an easily accessible source of
water . Major cities , communities , factories ,
industries , and power stations are
located along rivers . It is , therefore , very
important to protect the quality and
integrity of rivers all over the
world .
