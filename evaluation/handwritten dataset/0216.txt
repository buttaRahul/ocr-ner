Mother to Son .
Well, son . I'll tell you . 
life for me ain't been no #crystal stair . 
It's hed tacks in It . 
And spliters , and boards torn up , 
And places with no carpet on the floor . 
I'se been a - climbin on
And reachin , landins , 
And sometimes goin in the dark 
Where there  # has been no light . 
So boy , don, t you turn back . 
Din't you set down on the steps . 
Cause you finds it's kinder hard . 
#cause you finds it's kinder 
For I'se still goin , honey . 
And life for me ain't been 
no crystal stair . 
I'se still Climbin . 
And #reachin on .
