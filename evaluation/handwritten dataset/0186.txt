Stytistics can trace its roots to the
formalist tradition that developed in 
Russian theory at the turn of the 20th
century , particularly in the work of the
Moscow linguistic circle . Its most famous 
member Id and the most well-known
exponent of Russian formalism was
Roman Jakobson , whose work focused 
on defining the qualities of what he
termed ' poetic language ' . The poetic language
of function is realised in those communication
acts where the focuses is an message 
for its own sake I as opposed , say , to 
a communicative act focused on conversing
the emotions of the speakers . Jakobson's
work was to have tremendous influence 
on the development of stytistic , not
least as a result of his varied academic 
career and the opportunities .
