Biomass in the carbon cycle , including
plants and animals , is the reservoir of
carbon that we are most likely most
familiar with , and also the reservoir that
is most readily available to us . We all
participate in the flux of consumption
of carbon when we eat food . All of
our food is simply plant and / or
animal biomass . Our body takes the
carbon molecules contained in this
biomass , and uses them , along with
the oxygen we breathe in , for cellular
respiration to create the # adenosine
triphosphate ( ATP ) we need for
energy . The products of cellular
respiration include the CO2 we
exhale , water , and energy that
is stored in ATP .
