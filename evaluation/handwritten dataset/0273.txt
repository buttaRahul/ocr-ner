Most precipitation falls in the form rain . There
are three main kinds of rain ; frontal , convect-
ive and orographic . Frontal rainfall is
precipitation formed when two air fronts
of different temperatures and moisture
content converge . Convective rainfall is
formed when intense localized heating
causes hot moist air to raise and
condense and form rain clouds . Intense
rain would then fall as the clouds
get supersaturated . Orographic rainfall
is rain that form over mountains . When
a moist air mass encounters a mountain , it
# rises & cools . As it cools water vapor
condenses to form rain cloud that produces
rain of the windward side of the mountain .
Most of the rain ends up as surface water
runoff . Surface water is a major component
of the hydrological cycle & one that we
