The crystalline structure , ice , has a more
open structure than the liquid #form
of water . The open structure of ice
makes ice less dense than liquid
water . The lower density of ice ,
causes it to float on the surface
of liquid water . This phenomenon is
exemplified by icebergs in the
ocean and ice cubes in a
glass of ice water . When lakes
and ponds experience Freezing
temperatures the top water
molecule will cool first and form
ice . Since ice is less dense
than liquid water , the ice will
stay on the surface of the pond
creating an insulating barrier
that keeps the water below #
