Hydrogen Bonds :- 
Due to water’s polarity , each
water molecule attracts other water
molecules as oppositely charged ends
of the molecules attract each
other . When this happens , a weak
interaction occurs between the positive
hydrogen end from one molecule
and the negative oxygen end
of another molecule . This interaction
is called a hydrogen bond . As
water molecules make hydrogen bonds
with each other , water takes on some
unique physical and Chemical
charact#eristics not found in other liquids .
This hydrogen bonding Contributes to the other
water properties discussed below .
