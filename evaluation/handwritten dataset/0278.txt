Since hydrogen bonds need to be broken
for water to evaporate , a substantial
amount of energy is used in the
evaporation process . As the water evaporates ,
energy is transferred from one source
and taken up by the process , cooling
the environment where the evaporation is
taking place . In many living organisms ,
including humans , the evaporation of
sweat ( which is 90 percent ) water allows
the organism to cool when significant
heat energy is transferred from the
organism to the water in the sweat ,
helping to maintain a constant
body temperature , , a process known
as homeostasis .
