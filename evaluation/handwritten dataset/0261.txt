Another important property
of water is adhesion , or the
attraction # between water molecules
and molecules of other substances
or objects . This attraction is
Sometimes Stronger than water’s
cohesive forces , especially when
water is exposed to charged
surfaces such as glass walls
of capillary tubes ( narrow glass
tube . This is because the water
molecules are attracted to the
charged glass walls of the tube
More than they are to each other
and , therefore , adhere to the tube .
This type of adhesion is called
capillary action .
