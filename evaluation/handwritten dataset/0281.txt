In addition to greenhouse gases , other manmade
changes may be forcing climate change . Increases
in near surface ozone from internal combustion
engines , aerosols such as carbon black , mineral
dust and aviation-induced exhaust are acting to
raise the surface temperature . This primarily
occurs due to a decrease in the ALBEDO
of light-colored surfaces by the darker
colored carbon black , soot , dust , or particulate
matter . As you know , it is more comfortable
to wear a white shirt on a hot summer
day than a black shirt . Why is this?
Because the lighter colored material bounces
more solar radiation back toward space than
the # darker-colored , allowing it #
to stay cooler .
