Veranica decides to die by Paulo
Coelho became my favorite novel
because of how human are easily
swayed . A person who initial
wanted to die feeling that she
had no purpose in life even if she
had everything on needs to be at
ease with living . After a stay at
mental hospital , because of her
#suicide attempt her heart becomes
very fragile and is given one month
or something to live . In that time
span she #figures out that life is
worth living even without purpose . The #
surprise ending is that she gets to
live because unbeknowest to her , she
was a subject to experiment that
succeeded
