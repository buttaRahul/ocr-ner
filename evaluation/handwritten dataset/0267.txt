Water has the highest specific heat
capacity of any substance that naturally
exist as liquid at room temperature
and # pressure . Water’s high
heat capacity is a property caused
by hydrogen bonding among the
molecules . Specific heat is defined
as the amount of heat one gram of
a substance must # absorb or lose
to change its temperature by one degree
Celsius . For water , this amount is
one calorie . Other substances have
lower heat capacities compared to
water , for example : oil = 0.4 calorie ,
For example , because # the specific
heat capacity of water is about
five times more than that of sand , dry
sand at the beach heats up faster
than the water but is also cools down
faster than the water .
