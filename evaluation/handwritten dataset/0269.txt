Atmosphere and precipitation
Precipitation is water released from
clouds in the form of rain ,
freezing rain , sleet , snow , or hail .
It is a primary connection in
the water cycle that provides for
the delivery of atmospher#ic
water to the earth . Rain
forms as water vapor in a rising
air mass condenses in the cloud
and form water drops . Condensation
is the process in which water
vapor in the air is changed
into liquid water . Condensation is crucial
to the water cycle because it is
responsible for the formation of
clouds . These clouds may produce
precipitation , which is the primary route for
water to return to the earth's surface
within the water cycle . Condensation
is the opposite of evaporation .
