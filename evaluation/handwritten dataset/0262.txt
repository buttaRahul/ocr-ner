Some of the water that falls as
Precipitation can infiltrate into the
ground and become part of ground-
water . Infiltration is the process by
which water enters the subsurface
by gravitation # pull . Some of the
water infiltrates into the ground and
replenishes aquifers ( saturated subsurface
material ) , which store huge amounts
of freshwater for long periods of
time . Some infiltration stays close to
the land surface and can seep back into
# surface-water bodies ( and the ocean )
as groundwater discharge , while some
groundwater finds openings in the
land # surface and emerges as
freshwater springs . Water that stays
in the soil closer to the # surface
can be absorbed through plant .
