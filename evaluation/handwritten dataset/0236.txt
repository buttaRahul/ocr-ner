LOCK AND KEY HYPOTHESIS :-
Lock and
key model were proposed by Emil 
Fisher in 1890 . 
MAIN POINTS :- 
According to this model : 
1) Specific key can open only a specific 
lock . 
2) In the same manner a specific enzyme 
can transfer only one su substrate into 
product . 
3) Each enzyme #has a particular active 
site , into which specific substrate 
fits exactly . 
4) According to this model the active site 
has a rigid structure . 
5) There is no modification in the active
site of enzyme .
