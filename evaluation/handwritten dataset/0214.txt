Once upon a time ,  son ,
They # used to laugh with
Their hearts and laugh with their
eyes : but now # they only 
laugh with their teeth , while 
their # ice-block-cold # eyes 
search behind my shadow .
there was a time # indeed 
they used to shake hands with their 
hearts :
but that's gone son 
Now they shake hand without hearts 
# while their left hands # 
Search my empty pockets. 
' Feel at home ! ' come again : 
They #say , and when I come 
at home  , once,  twice , 
There will be no  thrice _ 
for then I #find doors shut on me .
