The largest percentage of water withdrawn
in the US goes to thermoelectric cooling . In
some countries , such as Egupt , irrigation accounts
for over 70% of water withdrawn . Irrigation
#is water that is applied by a water
system to sustain plant growth . Irrigation
also includes water that is used for
frost protection , application of chemical ,
weed control , feild preparation , crop cooling ,
harvesting , dust suppression , and leaching salts
from the root zone . Water is being
used at very #high rates throughout
worldwide due to human population growth
and industrialization . As more countries
become affluent ( increase in industrialization
and standard of living ) they consume
more water than they did when
they were less industrialized .
