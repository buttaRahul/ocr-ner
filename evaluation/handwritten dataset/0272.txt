Water also has a high heat of vaporization .
the amount of energy required to change one
gram of a liquid substance to a gas . A
considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 calories )
is required to accomplish this change in
water . This Process occurs on the surface of
water . As liquid water heats up , the
# # # hydrogen bonding makes it
difficult to separate Individual liquid water
molecules from each other , which is
required for water to enter the gas phase
( steam ) . Thus water acts as a heat sink
& requires much more heat to boil
than liquids such as ethanol , whose
# hydrogen bonds are weaker .
