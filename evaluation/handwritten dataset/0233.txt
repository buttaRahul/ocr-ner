Look at the night sky , and you see 
primarily darkness . A vast multitude
of glittering sparks drift over our
heads , scattered across the sky . Our
gaze registers their beauty but
little else . Our vision cannot bring
these dazzling pinpoints into focus ,
obsene their true nature . To our eyes , 
# # they are mysteries .
Humanity has sought to move beyond 
the limited vision of biology since
the days oF Galileo . Telescopes have 
# brought the heavens to Earth , 
exposed the distant treasures of the 
universe , revealed countless galaxies 
cloaked within the apparent darkness .
