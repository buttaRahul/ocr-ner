The Physical State of Water on Earth .
Water on Earth can naturally exist in three
states of matter , solid , liquid or gas depending on
prevailing temperature and pressure conditions .
Majority of water on Earth’s surface exists in
liquid form which is one of the reasons why #Earth
is capable of supporting life . When heat is added
to liquid water ( increasing temperature ) the kinetic energy
of water , the heigher kinetic energy of back up
the hydrogen bonds . As more heat is added to
boiling water , the higher kinetic energy of
the water molecules # causes the hydrogen
bonds to break completely and allow individual
molecules to escape into the air as water
vapor ( gas ) . On the other hand , when the temperature
of liquid water is reduced and water freezes ,
water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained
by hydrogen bonding .
