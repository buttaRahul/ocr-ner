Have you ever filled a glass of water
to the very top and then slowly added
a few more drops ? Before it overflows , the
water forms a dome-like shape above
the rim of the glass . This water can
stay above the rim of the glass because
of the property of # water known as
cohesion . In cohesion , water molecules are attrac-
ted to other water molecules ( because of
hydrogen bonding ) , keeping the molecules together
at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface
allowing water molecules to protrude above
the top surface of the glass . Cohesion
allows for the development of surface
tension , the capacity of a substance to
resist rupture when placed under
tension or stress .
