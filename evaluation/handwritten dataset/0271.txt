The impoundments can trap stream
sediments resulting in reduced sedi-
ment supply downstream , as well
as increased deposition behind the
dam . This shift in sediments flow
can disrupt and damage aquatic
habitats and can increase downstream
stream erosion due to lack of
sediment supply . The impoundments can
also prevent certain aquatic organisms
from migrating either # upstream
or downstream , therefore , reducing
their range and ability to survive
environmental changes as well cutting
them off from spawning areas ( e.g
salmon spawning ) . Construction of
dams can also result in displacement of
the local people & loss of traditional lands
and cultural history to the reservoirs and
ponds that usually # form behind these impoundments .
