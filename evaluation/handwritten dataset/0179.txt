Gabriel Garcia Marquez , being a post-modern
writer , has bombarded his novel  " One hundred
years od solitude " with a multitude of
post-modern fiction elements throughout the
novel . We find features such as
magical realism ,  concept where we see
a blend of both the supernatural and
fantastic with a hint of realism imbued
within it at some level . furthermore ,
we also see the features of
inter-textuality in the form of pastiche
( works that are inspired by the works
of other writers ) . Finally we may
highlight element  of time that
is portrayed in this novel from start
to finish of the novel . we see time
in ways such as ; linear progression ,
random jumps two difficult events and
certain instances where time staays completely still .
