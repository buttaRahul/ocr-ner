Evaporation is the process by which water
changes from a liquid to a gas or #vapour
Evaporation is the primary pathway that
water takes from the liquid state back
into the water cycle as atmospheric
water vapour . Nearly 90% of moisture in
the atmosphere comes from evaporation ,
with the remaining 10% # coming
from transpiration . Transpiration is the
process by which moisture is carried
through plants from roots to small
pores ( stoma ) on the underside of leaves ,
where it changes to vapour and
is released to the atmosphere . Transpiration
is essentially evaporation of water from
plant leaves .
