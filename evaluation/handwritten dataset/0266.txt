A wetland is an area which is
home to standing water for notable parts
of the year , has saturated soil for a
large part of the year and has plants
that are adapted to surviving under
flooded conditions or in saturated soils .
They are transitional areas between the
terrestrial land and the aquatic
environments such as rivers , lakes , and
oceans . Some major #wetland types
include swamps ( dominated by trees ) ,
marshes ( dominated by non-woody plants ) ,
and bogs ( dominated by moss ) . Westlands
are identified using three characteristic :
soils ( water-saturated soils # are
present ) , hydrology ( shallow water table )
and vegetation ( westland plants that
are adapted to areas that are saturated
with water for long periods of time ) .
