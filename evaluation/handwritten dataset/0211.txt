We have read a topic before ma'am

Like ma'am give us proper # heading ,
for the purpose that we understand
properly sequence wise - In the topic
we study about the the concept 
given by ' frantz fanon ' the self , the 
Other , the other - we study this very concept
with the help of Jacque Lacan phycho
- analytical theory – There is Imagary order in
which we study how the child develop
images in the very early age . That how
the child develop a sense of its own
body - when the child is infront of a
mirror did not recognise firstly then
he staring at the mirror and then develop
an image that there is another person who
live in the same house . So going through
this the  child learn sense of image development .
