I have recently read a book name as " Every thing
is Fucked " by Markmanson . In this book Mark Manson
is telling about hope . In one of the chapter of the
book he is telling about Newtons life and his laws of
Motion . he relate it with other Universe which he
called it as parallel Universe and he describe the
emotions and childhood of newton in this book . He also
# relate Newtons laws of Motion #with Newtons
Law of Emotions and In this law he describe
the # truth of the World .
