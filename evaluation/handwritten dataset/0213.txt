Mother to son . 
( Poem )
Well son , I will tell you . 
Life for me hasnot been no crystal stair 
It's had tacks in it . And splinters 
And #boards torn up . 
And places with me no carpet on the the #floor .
Bare But all the time . # # # # 
I'se been a climbin' on , 
and reachin Landin's . And turnin corners#
And something going in the dark 
Where there ain't been #no ligth . 
So boy don't you turn back . 
Don't you set down on the steps . 
Cause you finds its kinder hard . 
Don't you fall #now - For I'se still goin , honey . 
I'se still climbin . 
And life for me is not been 
no crystal stair .
