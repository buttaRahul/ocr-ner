Good Timber
The tree # that never had to fight
For sun and sky and air and light ,
But stood out # in the open plain
And # always got its share of rain ,
Never # became a forest king
But lived and # died as he began .
# The man who never had to toil 
To gain and # farm 
his patch of soil , who never had
to # win his share of sun
and sky and light and
air , Never # became a
manly man But #lived and 
# died as he began .
