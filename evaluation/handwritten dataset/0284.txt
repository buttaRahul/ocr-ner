A river forms from water moving from higher to lower
altitude ( elevation ) , under the force of gravity . When
rain falls on the land , it can seep into the ground ,
become runoff ( water running on the surface ) , or
evaporate . Water that moves as runoff on the land
surface usually converges as it moves towards
lower elevation . The converging runoff can concentrate
into single channels of conveyance called creeks ,
stream , or rivers. usually these #start as small rill
and rivulets that would join up downhill into
larger creeks , which then become streams later join
up downstream to form even bigger channels referred
to as rivers . The streams and small rivers that join
up to form a larger river are called tributaries .
The land area drained by a river and all its
tributaries is called a watershed or catchment
or river basin .
