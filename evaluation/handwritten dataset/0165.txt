There were many threats to life in
the past , but the things happened rece-
-ntly were a great damage to human
life . Things now the world is faci-
-ing is a social threat . There are
many things that affected human
life but this is more dangerous
if it happened again . As from
the discussion i mean the effects
of covid-19 on human life . It
stopped the whole world and the
isolation makes me speachless . Buisin-
-nesses and works all over the world
were disturbed greatly . People were
limited to home and irritated . We
all have seen sorrow and pain
on people faces . We recognised
it but recognized lately and
were too good to face it .
