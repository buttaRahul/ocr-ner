A Dream within a Dream
Take this kiss upon the brow 
And , in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow -
You are not wrong , who deem 
That my days have been a dream ;
yet if hope has flown away#
In a night , or in a day . 
In a vision , or in none ,
Is it therefore the less gone ?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream . 
O God ! can I not grasp 
Them with a tighter clasp ?
O God ! can I not save
One from the #pitiless wave ? 
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream ?
